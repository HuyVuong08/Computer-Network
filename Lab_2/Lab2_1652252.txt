1.  My computer and server both opperate on HTTP 1.1

2.  Accept Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

3.  My IP address:                          192.168.1.106
    gaia.cs.umass.edu server's IP address:  221.133.13.123

4.  The status code returned was 200 OK

5.  The file was last modified on Wednesday, February 27, 2013 at 01:04:01 GMT

6.  128 bytes of content are being returned

7.  I do not see any different headings between the two windows

8.  No there is no IF-MODIFIED-SINCE line in the GET message.

9.  The server did explicitly return the contents of the file. Wireshark includes 
    a section titled “Line-Based Text Data” which shows what the server sent back 
    to my browser which is specifically what the website showed when I brought it 
    up on my browser.

10. Yes in the second HTTP message an IF-MODIFIED-SINCE line is included. 
    The information that follows is the date and time that I last accessed the webpage

11. The HTTP status code is “304: Not Modified”
    The server did not return the contents of the file because the browser simply 
    retrieved the contents from its cache. Had the file been modified since it was last 
    accessed, it would have returned the contents of the file, instead it simply told 
    my browser to retrieve the old file from its cached memory.

12. My browser only sent 1 HTTP GET request to the server. The Packet that contained the 
    GET message was packet number 289.

13. The packet that contains the status code and phrase which the server sent in response 
    to the GET message was packet number 301.

14. The code and phrase in the response was 200 OK

15. The data was sent in 3 TCP segments to the browser, then reassembled.

16. My browser sent 3 http GET message requests. One each to each for each of the following: 
    The initial page, the Pearson logo, and the cover of the Pearson book, 5th Edition.
    Initial Page address: 128.119.245.12
    Pearson Logo: 165.193.140.14
    Pearson book, 5th Edition: 128.119.240.90

17. The browser downloaded the two images in serially. I believe this to be the case because 
    the first image was requested and sent before the second image was requested by the browser. 
    Had they been running in parallel, both files would have been requested then would have 
    returned in the same time period. In this case however, the second image was only requested 
    after the first image came back.

18. The servers intial response was “401 Authentication Required”

19. The new field that is now included is the authorization field. This is included because we 
    sent the server a username and password along with our request stating that we were authorized 
    to receive the page.
